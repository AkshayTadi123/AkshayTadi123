Hi, I’m Akshay Tadi. I'm a sophomore studying Computer Science with a minor in Applied Mathematics at the Lassonde School of Engineering - York University.
I’m interested in Quant, Machine Learning, Web Development, and just indulging in anything that seems fun!
I’m currently focused on enchancing my web-development knowldege and skills along with keenly observing financial markets and trends. Moreover, I am also continuing my journey in ML and hope to actually put the knowledge I've learnt into a project in the near future.
This GitHub will serve as a collection of the projects I have worked on, whether they be extremely trivial or my best work. Please take a look and reach out to me for further interaction!
